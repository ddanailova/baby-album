    <h2>My name is Lilly</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Lilly and I am a fictional character. My sole purpose is inhabiting this blog and giving it
      life. Some of the lines that you will read here will make no sense to you but don't worry, there is a reason for
      that. See, in my world, we don't use the same words that you do. Like in every foreign country you visit it takes
      you some time to adjust and start understanding the people around you. My world, it is exactly the same. The more
      you look, the more meaning you will find and the more you will start understanding my habitat. If I was a real
      person, I would be a good person so let me give you a few advises. Start with the big things like the titles, the
      pictures, the buttons, all the things that look familiar. Once you feel more comfortable try reading the text
      more carefully and if you start seeing the meaning it is because you have crossed the border and you are now in
      my world. If I was a real person, I would also be a curious one, so don't worry and let's explore together!
