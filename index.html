<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<section class="about">
  <h3>My name is Lilly</h3>
  <p>
Hello! My name is Lilly and I am a fictional character. My sole purpose is inhabiting this blog and giving it life. Some of the lines that you will read here will make no sense to you but don't worry there is a reason for that. See, in my world, we don't use the same words that you do. Like in every foreign country you visit it take you some time to adjust and start understanding the people around you. In my world, it is the same. The more you look the more meaning you will find and the more you will understand about my habitat. But is I was a real, I would also be a good person so let me give you a few advises. Start with the titles, the pictures, the buttons, all the things that are already familiar. Once you feel more comfortable try reading the text more carefully and if you start seeing the meaning it is because you have crossed the border and you are now in my world. If I was a real person, I would be a curious one, so don't worry and let's explore together!
